## Project Details
This is a responsive weather web app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with most of the logic handled in JavaScript integrated directly within the HTML file.
Just enter any city or country name, and the app will show the current weather, local time, and the searched cityâ€™s time with accurate results.
The background color changes dynamically based on the weather conditions, making the interface more engaging.
Optimized for all devices, it's a quick and reliable way to check weather and time from anywhere.
